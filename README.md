🔮 Future Improvements (Planned v2)

This project currently supports a single event, but future versions may expand the platform into a reusable event management system.

Possible improvements include:

Multi-Event Support

Allow the system to manage RSVPs for multiple events such as:

Quinceañeras

Weddings

Birthdays

Family gatherings

This would likely involve adding an Event model and linking RSVPs to a specific event.

Photo Gallery

Allow guests to upload photos taken during the event.

Potential features:

Guest photo uploads

Shared photo gallery for attendees

Ability to download event photos

Moderation tools for admins

Possible storage solutions:

Dropbox API

Cloud storage providers

External file hosting services
